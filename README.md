Fig5C contains the data for Tick and Aedes repellency, with columns 15-24 being the binary outputs of the repellency.

Fig6B contains the % repellency for Anopheles mosquitoes (column 2), Aedes mosquitoes (column 3), and ticks (column 4) to the different tested compounds (column 1). 

The USDA dataset contains the tested compounds in the 1942-1947 dataset.
